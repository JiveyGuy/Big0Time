COSC2336 - Lab 3  Studdy the impact of O() on a problem solution and learn to design and tweak an experiment: 1 - Use the 3 different algorithms for Maximum Contiguous Subsequence Sum, you can copy the code from http://www.crazyforcode.com/maximum-sum-in-contiguous-subarray/ - Give credit. You will need to tweak the code to make it work. You can also simplify the code... 2 - Use StopWatch class from the book for timing 3 - Build a tester that:   * Generates datasets randomly   * Run all 3 algorithm with each generated dataset   * You will need multiple test-runs to establish N such that value of T(N) are neither too short (Resolution is mili-second) or too long (Longer than ~ 1 day)   * Initially loop multiplying the dataset size by 2 (Initial multiplier) every time 4 - Follow the analysis of experimental data from the book page 176. Plot the data using excel 5 - From this estimate a good starting N and increment such that your table will have at least 4 lines with all 3 results 6 - Run the test and repeat 10 times to obtain an average (you can test with other work-load present or computer idle) 7 - Build a table that shows N vs. average / minimum / maximum T(N) for all 3 algorithms 8 - Turn a professional looking report:   a. describes the experiment   b. include the code   c. include a sample run   d. explain the final set of numbers you used (starting size and multiplier and time cut-off)   e. explain the findings   f. estimate the constant factors for all 3 algorithms assuming aN-cube, bN-square, and cN.  9 - Turn in your code (.java) and the report via e-mail to epcc.fblando@gmail.com
